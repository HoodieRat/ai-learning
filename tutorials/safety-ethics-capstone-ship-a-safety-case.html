  <h1>Safety &amp; Ethics Capstone: Ship a Safety Case</h1>
  <p class="lede">You’ll create a lightweight “safety case” for an AI feature: what could go wrong, what mitigations exist, what you evaluate, and what you monitor after launch.</p>

  <h2>Prereqs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="?t=safety-ethics-pitfalls-data-leakage-and-bias">Safety &amp; Ethics: Pitfalls</a></li>
    <li><a href="?t=evaluation-hands-on-design-a-rubric-and-judge">Evaluation: Hands-on Rubric + Judge</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Artifact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Risk register (top risks + mitigations)</li>
    <li>Evaluation plan (cases + pass criteria)</li>
    <li>Monitoring plan (what to watch after launch)</li>
    <li>Escalation path (who decides when to pause)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Plan your safety case</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick one AI-assisted workflow about to launch.</li>
    <li>List top 8 risks; map one mitigation per risk.</li>
    <li>Define evaluation: representative cases, pass bar, and who reviews.</li>
    <li>Set monitoring: 3–5 signals, thresholds, and on-call/escalation.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Mini build: write and review</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Draft the one-page safety case with the four sections above.</li>
    <li>Share with a teammate; ask them to find one missing risk.</li>
    <li>Add that risk and mitigation; tighten any vague language.</li>
    <li>Store the case with the runbook so operators can find it.</li>
  </ol>

    <h2>Practice Lab</h2>
    <p><strong>Task:</strong> Produce a safety case for a real feature.</p>
    <p><strong>Do:</strong> Pick one AI-assisted workflow you might ship. Write a one-page safety case covering: risks, mitigations, evaluation, monitoring, and escalation.</p>
    <p><strong>Success criteria:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>At least 5 risks are listed with concrete mitigations.</li>
      <li>Evaluation includes representative cases and pass criteria.</li>
      <li>Monitoring includes at least 3 signals and thresholds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verify:</strong> Have a colleague review the safety case and identify one missing risk; update accordingly.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>Recap</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Safety cases make risks and mitigations explicit before launch.</li>
    <li>Evaluation and monitoring need owners and thresholds.</li>
    <li>Peer review catches blind spots; keep the case alongside the runbook.</li>
  </ul>
