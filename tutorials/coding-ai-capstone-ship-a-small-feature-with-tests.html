  <h1>Coding AI Capstone: Ship a Small Feature with Tests</h1>
  <p class="lede">You’ll plan, implement, and verify a small end-to-end feature using AI — while keeping code reviewability and safety as first-class requirements.</p>

  <h2>Prereqs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="?t=coding-ai-pitfalls-overreliance-and-security">Coding AI: Pitfalls</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Artifact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A small feature (one user story)</li>
    <li>Tests that prove the behavior</li>
    <li>A short “verification notes” writeup</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Plan your feature</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Write the user story and acceptance criteria (including one edge case).</li>
    <li>Break into 3–4 steps; ask AI for a plan but keep changes small.</li>
    <li>Decide tests per acceptance criterion before coding.</li>
    <li>Note any security or data-handling requirements.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Mini build: deliver and verify</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Implement step 1; run tests; review diff for unintended changes.</li>
    <li>Add the next step; expand tests with at least one edge/abuse case.</li>
    <li>Write a short verification note: what you checked, what still worries you.</li>
    <li>Ask a teammate (or AI) to critique the tests; adjust if gaps appear.</li>
  </ol>

    <h2>Practice Lab</h2>
    <p><strong>Task:</strong> Deliver a feature with verification notes.</p>
    <p><strong>Do:</strong> Write a user story and acceptance criteria. Ask AI for a step plan, implement in small steps, and verify with tests.</p>
    <p><strong>Success criteria:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Acceptance criteria are met and tested.</li>
      <li>At least one edge case is covered.</li>
      <li>You can explain what you verified and how.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verify:</strong> Have someone else read your tests and confirm they match the user story.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>Recap</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Acceptance criteria drive both code and tests; keep them explicit.</li>
    <li>Ship in small, verifiable steps; review diffs every step.</li>
    <li>Verification notes make review faster and safer.</li>
  </ul>
