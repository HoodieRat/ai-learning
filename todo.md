## Quiz removal & enrichment
- [x] Removed quiz engine wiring and quiz metadata
- [x] Replaced quiz placeholders with practice prompts and external links (first batch of tutorials)

## Tutorial overhaul (tool-led, end-to-end)
- [x] Document default tool stacks by track (Local AI, Image, Video, Audio, RAG, Coding, Agentic, Safety, Hardware) in tutorials and intro copy
- [x] Upgrade Local AI tutorials with concrete Ollama/LM Studio steps, commands, and expected outputs
- [x] Upgrade Image/Video tutorials with ComfyUI/Automatic1111 (and optional Pika/Runway) flows and assets
- [x] Upgrade RAG tutorials with LangChain + Chroma + sample corpus and evaluation checkpoints
- [x] Upgrade Audio tutorials with Whisper STT + XTTS/Piper TTS labs and sample clips
- [x] Upgrade Coding/Agentic/Safety tutorials with runnable loops, logs, and verification steps

## Deepen key tutorials (start → run → verify)
- [x] Image AI track (models, prompting, control/inpaint, pitfalls, capstone): add ComfyUI + A1111 command blocks, sample seed PNGs, troubleshoot checklist
- [x] Video AI track (basics, storyboard-to-clips, pitfalls, capstone): add AnimateDiff settings, sample storyboard/keyframes, ffmpeg concat command, flicker/identity troubleshooting
- [x] RAG track (basics, tuning, pitfalls, capstone): add runnable LangChain + Chroma scripts, tiny corpus, eval harness with citation checks and sample outputs
- [x] Evaluation track (metrics vs judges, hands-on, pitfalls, capstone): add rubric template, metric vs judge scripts, sample scored outputs, failure-modes table
- [x] Local AI track (Ollama, LM Studio, performance, pitfalls, capstone): confirm install/run/verify commands and sample logs across pages
- [x] Hardware track (CPU vs GPU vs NPU, performance, budget, pitfalls, capstone): tighten sizing tables and verification steps
- [x] Audio AI track (basics, hands-on, pitfalls, capstone): add concrete faster-whisper/XTTS/Piper commands and sample clips
- [x] Coding/Agentic track (workflow, hands-on loops, pitfalls, capstones): ensure diffs/logging/guardrails and test commands are explicit
- [x] Safety/Ethics track (practical use, pitfalls, capstones): add red-team prompts, prescriptive checks, and local logging guidance
- [x] Prompting/AI Literacy track: ensure start-to-finish labs, verification steps, and failure examples are present
- [x] Add sample assets bundle (corpus, keyframes, logs/CSVs, prompts) and link from tutorials

## Summary / Next steps
- All tracks deepened; assets linked in tutorials.
- Sample bundles live in assets/examples (see assets-index.md).
- Optional: run sample scripts to capture fresh outputs/logs for docs.
