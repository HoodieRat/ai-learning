  "title": "Agentic Flows: Planner, Router, Memory — Quiz",
  "passingScore": 70,
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "In an agent loop, the planner primarily:",
      "options": [
        "Proposes steps toward a goal",
        "Executes API calls directly",
        "Stores secrets long-term",
        "Guarantees correctness"
      ],
      "answer": "Proposes steps toward a goal",
      "explanation": "The planner decomposes the goal into steps and success criteria; it’s distinct from tool execution."
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "The router’s job is to:",
      "options": [
        "Choose which tool or sub-agent to use next",
        "Rewrite the entire plan every step",
        "Disable logging",
        "Ignore failures"
      ],
      "answer": "Choose which tool or sub-agent to use next",
      "explanation": "Routing selects the right capability for the current step based on rules and context."
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Agent memory should have explicit rules for retention and redaction.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Without retention/redaction rules, agents can accidentally store or reuse sensitive data."
    },
    {
      "type": "multi-select",
      "question": "Which are good practices for agent memory?",
      "options": [
        "Store only what is needed for the task",
        "Avoid storing secrets and personal data",
        "Keep memory forever by default",
        "Add a clear TTL/retention policy"
      ],
      "answer": [
        "Store only what is needed for the task",
        "Avoid storing secrets and personal data",
        "Add a clear TTL/retention policy"
      ],
      "explanation": "Memory should be minimal and governed; default forever-retention increases risk."
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is a verifier gate in an agent system?",
      "options": [
        "A check that validates evidence before an action is taken",
        "A tool that makes the agent faster",
        "A prompt that guarantees truth",
        "A logging format"
      ],
      "answer": "A check that validates evidence before an action is taken",
      "explanation": "Verifier gates reduce risk by requiring proof or checks before state-changing actions."
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Budgets (max steps/tool calls/time) help prevent runaway agent behavior.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Budgets are a practical containment mechanism for loops and repeated tool failures."
