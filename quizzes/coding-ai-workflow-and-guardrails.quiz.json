  "passingScore": 70,
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the safest way to use AI for coding changes?",
      "options": [
        "Ask for small diffs and verify with tests",
        "Ask for a full rewrite and merge immediately",
        "Skip code review to save time",
        "Never run the code"
      ],
      "answer": "Ask for small diffs and verify with tests",
      "explanation": "Small changes are easier to review, and tests provide evidence the behavior is correct."
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "If the code compiles, it is necessarily correct.",
      "answer": false,
      "explanation": "Compilation is not correctness; logic and edge cases still need tests and review."
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is a characterization test?",
      "options": [
        "A test that captures current behavior before refactoring",
        "A test that measures GPU speed",
        "A test that proves the model is unbiased",
        "A test that formats code"
      ],
      "answer": "A test that captures current behavior before refactoring",
      "explanation": "Characterization tests lock in behavior so refactors don’t accidentally change outputs."
    },
    {
      "type": "multi-select",
      "question": "Which are good guardrails when using AI for coding?",
      "options": [
        "Run tests and add edge cases",
        "Review diffs like a human reviewer",
        "Trust hallucinated APIs",
        "Threat-model hostile inputs"
      ],
      "answer": [
        "Run tests and add edge cases",
        "Review diffs like a human reviewer",
        "Threat-model hostile inputs"
      ],
      "explanation": "Verification and threat modeling reduce common AI-assisted coding risks; trusting invented APIs increases them."
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is a good prompt for implementing a feature?",
      "options": [
        "Include requirements, constraints, and expected tests",
        "Just say: ‘do it’",
        "Only provide function names",
        "Avoid mentioning non-goals"
      ],
      "answer": "Include requirements, constraints, and expected tests",
      "explanation": "Clear requirements and verification expectations drive better outputs and easier review."
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "It’s useful to ask the AI to list assumptions before it writes code.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Assumptions often hide correctness bugs; surfacing them early prevents wrong implementations."
