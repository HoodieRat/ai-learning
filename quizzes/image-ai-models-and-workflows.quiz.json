  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Why is using a fixed seed (or equivalent) useful when iterating?",
      "options": [
        "It improves repeatability so you can measure changes",
        "It guarantees perfect quality",
        "It forces the model to follow facts",
        "It makes prompts shorter"
      ],
      "answer": "It improves repeatability so you can measure changes",
      "explanation": "Repeatability helps you attribute differences to a prompt/setting change instead of randomness."
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "A constraint-first workflow can help produce more consistent images.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Constraining composition/identity reduces degrees of freedom and improves consistency."
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What’s a good strategy to improve consistency across a set?",
      "options": [
        "Vary only one variable at a time",
        "Change subject, style, and camera all at once",
        "Avoid documenting settings",
        "Never use references"
      ],
      "answer": "Vary only one variable at a time",
      "explanation": "Controlling variables reduces drift and makes it easier to debug why a set doesn’t match."
    },
    {
      "type": "multi-select",
      "question": "Which are common image generation failure modes?",
      "options": [
        "Artifacts",
        "Style drift",
        "Prompt leakage",
        "Guaranteed accuracy"
      ],
      "answer": [
        "Artifacts",
        "Style drift",
        "Prompt leakage"
      ],
      "explanation": "Artifacts, drift, and leakage are common; accuracy guarantees don’t exist for generative outputs."
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is a targeted edit (inpainting-style) best used for?",
      "options": [
        "Fixing a localized flaw without changing the whole image",
        "Replacing the need for constraints",
        "Making the model factual",
        "Increasing the image resolution automatically"
      ],
      "answer": "Fixing a localized flaw without changing the whole image",
      "explanation": "Targeted edits let you preserve what works and fix only the broken region."
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Keeping a written log of changes helps you build a repeatable workflow.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Logging prompts/settings turns trial-and-error into a process you can repeat and improve."
    }
