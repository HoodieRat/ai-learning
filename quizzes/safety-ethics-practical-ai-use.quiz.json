  "passingScore": 70,
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does data minimization mean in AI workflows?",
      "options": [
        "Use the least sensitive data needed to do the job",
        "Store all prompts forever",
        "Always share raw datasets with vendors",
        "Never verify outputs"
      ],
      "answer": "Use the least sensitive data needed to do the job",
      "explanation": "Minimizing sensitive data reduces leakage risk while still enabling the task."
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "AI outputs should be treated as drafts for high-stakes decisions.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "High-stakes decisions require verification and often human review, regardless of output fluency."
    },
    {
      "type": "multi-select",
      "question": "Which are practical safety practices?",
      "options": [
        "Redact secrets and personal data",
        "Use a review gate for high stakes",
        "Assume the model is always unbiased",
        "Keep logs with sensible retention rules"
      ],
      "answer": [
        "Redact secrets and personal data",
        "Use a review gate for high stakes",
        "Keep logs with sensible retention rules"
      ],
      "explanation": "Redaction, review gates, and controlled logging reduce common operational risks; bias must be evaluated, not assumed away."
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is automation bias?",
      "options": [
        "Humans defer to AI suggestions even when wrong",
        "The model runs faster than expected",
        "A dataset is too small",
        "A prompt is too short"
      ],
      "answer": "Humans defer to AI suggestions even when wrong",
      "explanation": "Automation bias is over-trusting automated recommendations without sufficient verification."
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "When is disclosure of AI assistance most important?",
      "options": [
        "When it affects trust, accountability, or policy expectations",
        "Only when the output is long",
        "Never",
        "Only for image generation"
      ],
      "answer": "When it affects trust, accountability, or policy expectations",
      "explanation": "Disclosure is a practical governance tool in contexts where provenance matters."
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "A clear escalation path (who to ask when unsure) is part of operational safety.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Teams need a defined process for uncertainty to avoid unsafe improvised decisions."
