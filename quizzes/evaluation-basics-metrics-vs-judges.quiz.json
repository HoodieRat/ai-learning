    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the main purpose of evaluation?",
      "options": [
        "Measure whether a system meets requirements",
        "Make the model look smart",
        "Eliminate all errors",
        "Avoid user feedback"
      ],
      "answer": "Measure whether a system meets requirements",
      "explanation": "Evaluation checks performance against defined criteria so you can improve or decide readiness."
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Why can a single metric be misleading?",
      "options": [
        "It may hide important failure modes",
        "It is always too expensive",
        "It guarantees perfect accuracy",
        "It replaces qualitative review"
      ],
      "answer": "It may hide important failure modes",
      "explanation": "Aggregate metrics can mask rare but critical errors and bias in specific segments."
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Human or model-based judges can be useful, but they also require calibration and checks.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Judges can drift, be inconsistent, or encode bias; they should be validated."
    },
    {
      "type": "multi-select",
      "question": "Which practices improve evaluation quality?",
      "options": [
        "Representative test cases",
        "Clear rubrics",
        "Leakage prevention",
        "Measuring only one easy scenario"

      "answer": [
        "Representative test cases",
        "Clear rubrics",
        "Leakage prevention"
      ],
      "explanation": "Coverage, clear criteria, and preventing leakage are key; narrow testing is risky."

    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is data leakage in evaluation?",
      "options": [
        "Test data overlaps with training/context in a way that inflates scores",
        "A model refusing to answer",
        "A slow GPU",
        "A long prompt"
      ],
      "answer": "Test data overlaps with training/context in a way that inflates scores",
      "explanation": "Leakage makes evaluation optimistic because the system has effectively seen the answers."

    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Evaluation should be tied to user-facing requirements, not just generic benchmarks.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Benchmarks help, but product readiness depends on your actual use cases and constraints."
