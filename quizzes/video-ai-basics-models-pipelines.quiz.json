  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the biggest difference between video generation and image generation?",
      "options": [
        "Time consistency across frames",
        "Video prompts are always shorter",
        "Video has no artifacts",
        "Video never needs references"
      ],
      "answer": "Time consistency across frames",
      "explanation": "Video adds a temporal dimension, making stability and continuity major challenges."
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "A storyboard helps you define success criteria before generating clips.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Planning first prevents aimless iteration and makes it obvious when a clip fails."
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A good strategy to reduce flicker is to:",
      "options": [
        "Generate shorter clips and stitch",
        "Increase randomness as much as possible",
        "Change identity constraints every shot",
        "Avoid keyframes"
      ],
      "answer": "Generate shorter clips and stitch",
      "explanation": "Shorter generations can be more stable and easier to control; stitching preserves quality."
    },
    {
      "type": "multi-select",
      "question": "Which can improve continuity across shots?",
      "options": [
        "Reference images/keyframes",
        "Identity constraints",
        "Changing all variables per shot",
        "A style guide"
      ],
      "answer": [
        "Reference images/keyframes",
        "Identity constraints",
        "A style guide"
      ],
      "explanation": "References and constraints anchor identity and style; changing everything increases drift."
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is identity drift?",
      "options": [
        "The subject changes appearance over time",
        "The video file gets smaller",
        "The prompt becomes shorter",
        "The GPU runs cooler"
      ],
      "answer": "The subject changes appearance over time",
      "explanation": "Identity drift is when the character/subject morphs across frames or clips."
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "If you can’t describe what must stay consistent, you’ll struggle to get consistent outputs.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Explicit continuity constraints are what you enforce; without them, you can’t debug failures."
